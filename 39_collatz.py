    The Collatz Sequence also called the 3n + 1 problem, is a simple but mysterious numeric 
    sequence that has remained unsolved by mathematicians. It has four rules:
    - Begin with a positive, nonzero integer called n.
    - If n is 1, the sequence terminates.
    - If n is even, the next value of n is n / 2.
    - If n is odd, the next value of n is 3n + 1
